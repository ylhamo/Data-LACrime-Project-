This dataset captures crime incidents in the City of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, spanning 28 columns and over 1 million rows. I chose it because I’ve been eager to work with real-world data, and I find crime patterns particularly intriguing. Analyzing this dataset promises valuable insights, especially since it is so detailed and extensive—perfect for exploring trends, uncovering patterns, and practicing meaningful data analysis.
 
## Project Overview
Goals: Learn how to access, clean, annd analyze public data

Tools: R studio, Command Prompt, Powerbi, DuckBD

Methods / Approach
- Import and clean dataset using R and DuckDB
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends

- Apply summary statistics and visualizations to uncover insights

## Key Questions
- Which types of crimes are most common in LA?
