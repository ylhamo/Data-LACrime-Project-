This dataset captures crime incidents in the City of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, spanning 28 columns and over 1 million rows. I chose it because I’ve been eager to work with real-world data, and I find crime patterns particularly intriguing. Analyzing this dataset promises valuable insights, especially since it is so detailed and extensive—perfect for exploring trends, uncovering patterns, and practicing meaningful data analysis.
