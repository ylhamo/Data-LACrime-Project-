	This dataset contains records of crime incidents in the City of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. It includes 28 columns and 1,004,992 rows. I chose this dataset because I have been wanting to work with real-world data for some time. Additionally, I find crime patterns interesting, and I believe analyzing this data can provide valuable insights. The dataset is highly detailed and extensive, making it ideal for in-depth analysis.
