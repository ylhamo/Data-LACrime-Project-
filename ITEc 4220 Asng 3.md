[[ITEC 4220]]
To start, 
- [ ] create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html "R Markdown
(https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)") document in R Studio. Inside your R Markdown document, start by attaching your CSV file or linking to your dataset source so others can replicate your analysis. Then, add more code and Markdown text blocks for answering the questions below. We will go over this in class (also see [Markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html "Markdown
tutorial
(https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html)")). If unable to create an R Markdown document, see the **alternative submission instructions** at the bottom. Answer all of the questions inside your R Markdown document check its output regularly by running the Knit function in R Studio. Make sure it is properly formatted and reads like a real report.

## Questions

- [ ] Load your CSV dataset into R as instructed in previous assignment. Select columns to plot together to visualize your data. Plot a graph out of any of the ones we reviewed in class. Make sure axes, lines are annotated and it has a title. Briefly explain what your graph shows. Show the R code that resulted in the graph.
- [x] Do a simple statistical calculation (e.g. mean, standard deviation, mode, median, etc.) with R that aligns with your hypothesis and plot/report results. Explain what the result means in terms of your question.
- [x] We will apply statistical tests to your dataset to gain insight in answering your questions. Start by first applying a correlation or regression analysis to detect a relationship. Explain how the relationship aligns with your questions.
- [x] For the second statistical test, select a numerical column that you want to check. First, plot a histogram of it and discuss about its distribution. As you did with the above graph, make sure the histogram is properly annotated.
- [x] Then, divide your dataset into two groups of rows based on another column that matters for your question and apply a test that we discussed in class (t-test, ANOVA, ...) to test for significant differences between the two groups. Make sure the test you selected is consistent with the distribution that you observed earlier. Show the code and briefly explain the results.

After finishing all the questions, use the free Rpubs option to share your R Markdown document to create a link to post here. You will need to create a free account on Rpubs. Alternatively, use another [sharing option](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-share.html "sharing
option
(https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-share.html)").

## Alternative submission instructions:

In case you can't get an R Markdown to work for some reason, you can try one of the following, listed with most preferred first. If you post your report online, you can start having an online presence demonstrating your data science skills, which will help you find employment later. I may cut points if you don't have a valid reason for selecting an alternative to R Markdown. Select ONE of the following:

2. Create a public [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ "Gist
    (https://gist.github.com/)") and post the link here. It uses the basic [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "Markdown
    language
    (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)") where you can [insert images inline](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53560172 "insert images
    inline
    (https://stackoverflow.com/a/53560172)") with the text to make your report. Here is an [example Gist](https://gist.github.com/Ragedancer/15ee8e2b7b1a8cafb86b83ff7db1763f "example
    Gist
    (https://gist.github.com/Ragedancer/15ee8e2b7b1a8cafb86b83ff7db1763f)") and [another one](https://gist.github.com/sprice2/1aae96f077e81ba16cb654926d86e52b "another
    one
    (https://gist.github.com/sprice2/1aae96f077e81ba16cb654926d86e52b)").
3. Reply below like in previous assignments, and provide external links for images. This will be private to our class, so you get no public exposure.
4. Least desirable option: Make a Word doc and upload it somewhere(OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) so you can share the link here(you may lose points if you select this option).
